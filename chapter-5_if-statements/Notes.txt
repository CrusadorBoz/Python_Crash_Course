Checking for equality:

# It looks like you need to keep the = or > with no spaces after the variable. 
if ((age_0> 21) and (age_1>= 15)):
    print("The condition statement worked")
else:
    print("The condition statement did not work")


# The == test to see if the value of cars match.
# The == is asking a question if the value equals car.
